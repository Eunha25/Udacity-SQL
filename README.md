# SQL for Data Analysis

This repository contains the course materials and project for the online course [SQL for Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--cd0023). The course is designed to equip you with the necessary skills to manipulate and analyze large sources of table-based data using SQL. By mastering SQL, you'll be able to tackle complex business questions and optimize operations in various domains.

## Course Description

When it comes to data analysis, Excel can only take you so far. To handle larger datasets and perform more advanced analyses, SQL is a powerful tool that offers both speed and efficiency. This course will guide you through the fundamentals of SQL, teach you how to work with multiple tables, and provide the option to explore advanced topics such as subqueries and advanced joins. Furthermore, you'll have the opportunity to apply your knowledge in a hands-on project where you'll analyze a music store database and identify opportunities for operational optimization.

### What You Will Learn

- Basic SQL: Gain fluency in essential SQL commands, including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and corresponding logical operators.
- SQL Joins: Combine data tables using SQL joins to answer more complex business questions.
- SQL Aggregations: Aggregate data in SQL using functions like COUNT, SUM, MIN, and MAX, as well as work with CASE and DATE functions and handle NULL values.
- Advanced SQL Lessons (Optional): Explore subqueries (also known as CTEs) in various scenarios, use window functions (such as RANK, NTILE, LAG, LEAD) and partitions to accomplish complex tasks, optimize queries, clean data, and write advanced joins.

### Course Project: Query a Digital Music Store Database

In the course project, you will work on a provided dataset collected from an experiment. You'll leverage statistical techniques to extract insights from the data and present your findings and recommendations in a comprehensive report.
